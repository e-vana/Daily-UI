# Daily UI
## What is Daily UI?
Over the next 100 days, you'll design 100 different user interface elements for mobile and web. This project was built to provide a fun engaging way to improve your skills as a designer, earn rewards, and get feedback from others.

## Why am I doing this?
To stop thinking about _what_ to make and to just build something from a prompt.  An attempt to be more creative with a constraint involved.
